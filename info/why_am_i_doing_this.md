# Why am I doing this?

This project is my assigned paper for the seminar [Social Epistemology](https://jlandes.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/social-epistemology-2022.pdf) by [JÃ¼rgen Landes](https://jlandes.wordpress.com/) a the [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/). We read texts about social epistemology and agent based modeling, practiced programming in NetLogo and, in the end, discussed and designed our own versions of an agent based model.
